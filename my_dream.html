	<strong>At a tender age of 10,i have realised my dreams and with my small steps, I am moving forward towards it everyday.<br>My dream is to see the world from the space above when i grow up.So i wish to become an Astronaut.<br>I feel some great gravitation between me and the stars above.<br>I am sure this affinity among us help me achieve my goal faster.<br>I firmly believe that My life is not to make money alone but to make an impact.<br></strong>
