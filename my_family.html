		<p>You dont choose your family.They are God's gift to you as you are to them.<br>My grandparents are on the left corner,my chachi mom and chachu are there in the center with me in his arms supported by my parents on the right.<br>like all other families,We are not always happy and perfect.But unlike others,we are there for each other everytime, when it does matter the most.<br>As my chachu chachi have moved to Australia now,We don't always get along, we don't always see each other now like we used to.<br> But,love is there, sense of belonging and the assurance that we are here, we are family , in all things good and bad.<br>Time changes all the time, it is the Family what makes you go through it.
